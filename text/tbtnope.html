     wholetext="\xaaIris\n\n     It was a day unlike any other. At about 10:00 AM, as she was half way through reading her morning quota of flagged emails, Iris became <i>aware<\/i>, as if a new reality had revealed itself to her. Her old world of weekdays and weekends, due dates and deadlines, surveillance and supervisors fell away like a flimsy cardboard cutout to reveal something else. At the forefront of this new reality was a dull pain in her forearms which she suddenly realized had been there for weeks. The desk work in front of her was simultaneously meaningless and disgusting. Iris stood up, and when she peered over the dividers, she saw that everyone else was standing as well. The whole office left work that day, making their way out of the building in a calm and orderly fashion. Everyone on the planet took the day off.  \n\x1d\xaaJoseph\n\n     Joseph realized something was amiss when his daily briefing failed to arrive on his desk. Then, just as he was leaving the Oval Office to go ask for it, he noticed that his security detail was not guarding his door. At first he felt relief. How often had he tried to get away from it all, to catch even a moment of solitude, only to notice his detail, barely close enough to maintain visual contact, keeping him safe as always. He walked down the hall. Not a soul. And in the middle of the floor a leather briefcase. The nuclear football. A wave of intense panic rushed over him. He calmed himself. He rushed over to it, picked it up, and power walked to the bunker.\n\x1d\xaaTonita\n\n     Tonita skipped her morning meetings to take a long nap. Once rested, she packed her suitcase and tent, and got on the I-10 heading for Santa Fe. She had never felt at home in Irvine. When friends would ask her about it, she would give a polite smile and say, \"It\'s safe.\" She hated it. She might have been able to stomach the monochrome lawns, manicured hedges, beige houses and bland gray industrial parks if there had been anything of substance beneath the \u201Ccommunity\u2019s\u201D impersonal exterior. There wasn\u2019t. Worse still, as an employee of the Irvine Company, she sold it. She lauded the absence of personality as \"aesthetic cohesion\" and often described the city\'s greatest attraction, a shopping mall, as \"vibrant\". Tonita had dreamed of leaving ever since she had arrived. \n\x1d\xaaJefferey\n\n     Jefferey woke up in his ship\'s cabin ready for the long-awaited day. Six months ago, he had estimated the location of the Apollo 7 mission\'s left oxidizer tank must be in the South Atlantic Ocean, a few miles north of Ferraz Ridge, based on flight trajectory information, historical ocean current data, and numerical simulations. He had then amassed a crew of the most talented undersea navigators and salvage experts to run the SS <i>Legacy<\/i>, his 25 million dollar exploration class ship. And finally, after a year of planning (the most difficult was getting a week off from his duties as CEO), he would arrive at the site.\n \n     He left his room to find his crew around the dining table laughing, but as he approached the laughing stopped. After a moment, Andy, his number one spoke. \"Sorry Jeff, we\'re going back\"\n\x1d\xaaSabrina\n\n     Sabrina was in no state to go home as she watched the mall empty out. Usually at this point in the day she would take her smoke break and the nicotine would balance her hangover and float her until lunch, but she had tossed her cigarettes and flushed her oxys. She lay down on the hard carpet next to the less popular t-shirts (Nirvana, Happy Bunny, Che Guevara). She closed her eyes, trying to take a nap, but her head pounded and her body begged her for just one cigarette, even just a drag.\n \n     She remembered the day she received her first paycheck. It was the first month after she had run away from her parents and gotten a job at Orange Julius. They had finally processed her information and at the end of the day, the manager dropped by to hand her the envelope. She thought back to all of the hours she had worked, the smoothies she had poured. She had so many plans for the money, and today was the day. She opened the check and as she began to go through her accounts her heart sank. $1395.00 gross income, with taxes withheld left her at $965.34. $509.67 after rent and utilities, $53.14 after she paid off the credit card she had used to buy food and other necessities. \n \n     She looked up the cheapest house in town. At this rate, if she buckled down and saved all she could, and if the house stayed the same price, she could afford it in five hundred sixty-four years. She would never escape. Maybe, if she was lucky, she would get to spend the final decade or so of her life in a run-down nursing home, looking out of a window. A force stronger than fate had decided that her life would consist of pouring smoothies, folding shirts or some equally menial, ultimately pointless task. Sabrina felt empty, and while the fucking and drugs didn\'t actually fill the void, they provided a pleasant way to kill time as she waited to die.\n \n     Today, the force which had pushed her to despair had suddenly revealed itself to be a lie. She didn\'t feel foolish for believing it, after all, everyone had. She just felt relief, as though a terrible weight had been lifted. While her body ached and itched, it was balanced by the feeling she had anticipated in that first paycheck, multiplied a billionfold, as if she had opened an envelope to find her entire life, each moment worth more than a million hours of minimum wage. Sabrina\'s time was too valuable to deal with another shift manager or customer ever again.\n\x1d\xaaEmmanuel\n\n     Emmanuel was having dinner with Bernard and Vincent. A luxurious lobster and caviar dinner paired with bottles of Grand Cru. Not necessarily to celebrate. But they had done well. The pandemic had provided a variety of unique opportunities. It quelled protests better than the riot police with their teargas and flashballs ever had. And since people were getting used to living with less, it would be easy to increase the level of economic efficiency of the national labor market. \n\n     \"To our project!\" They cheersed, and laughed a hearty laugh, which eventually faded. The lobster didn\'t arrive. They poured another glass and waited. \n\n     \"You see that video of the yellow vest that lost an eye? He was actin\u2019 real tough, then bam, fucker can\u2019t even cry right no more.\"\n\n     \"Shut the fuck up Vincent.\" \n\n     Another glass. Emmanuel didn\'t like to think about those idiots. It wasn\'t his fault they didn\'t understand how the world works. He did his best to teach them. \"Hey! where\'s this fuckin lobster!\" They uncorked another bottle.\n\x1d\xaaIris\n\n     Iris\'s parents had brought out the champagne when she landed her job with Booz Allen Hamilton, but a few months later the pressures resumed. \"When will you be promoted? Maybe you should find a man and settle down. Remember Amy? She just had her second child..\" When she was younger Iris used to resent these sorts of comments, but with time, she came to understand. Her mother had probably had a round of tennis with Amy\'s mother, or maybe the fathers had played golf. The one-upmanship was central to Los Campanas\' status-obsessed culture and her parents were just as helpless as she was.\n \n     Iris drove to the Santa Fe Place Mall. Finally, after twenty years, she would dye her hair: \"Electric Lizard\". She still knew the name of that bright green shade she had asked her parents for when she was twelve. The request had sent the family into crisis: what had they done, her parents wondered, to deserve a daughter who wanted to look like a dirty gutter rat? She\'d come across the color again when she was shopping with her college friends and she had laughed with them about how cringe it was. Now, however, she was ready to embrace her heart\u2019s desire, which had endured her adolescence. Hopefully she could still find it at Hot Topic.\n\x1d\xaaSabrina\n\n     Sabrina awoke to the steady clopping crescendo of an approaching pair of high heels reverberating through the deserted mall. She sat up to see a woman in a business suit entering the store. \n\n     \"Are you lost?\" \n\n     \"Um, sorry, I\'m umm.. do you still carry Electric Lizard hair dye?\" \n\n     While the woman in her shiny black heels and dark gray business suit struck an imposing figure to Sabrina, who was still on the floor, her nervous tone was disarming, and Sabrina was intrigued. \n \n     Sabrina stood up and straightened herself out. \"You know, I think we\'re the only people left in this entire mall.\" \n\n     The woman laughed softly \"I know, I think everyone has a more important place to be.. I just.. always wanted to have green hair..\" \n\n     Sabrina\'s cigarette craving was gone, all she wanted was for her to stay. \"If you\'re going for a makeover let\'s go all the way.\"\n \n     For the next hour, the two girls tried on outfits and Iris, once reserved, began to warm up. After careful deliberation, Iris left the store in a short, ripped, black gothic dress that said Anarchy on the front in blood letters (and it was ALL ripped), complemented by a spiky belt and ripped black fishnets. \n \n     To celebrate, the girls went behind the Cold Stone counter and each served themselves a waffle cone with big scoops and cherries on top. The joy of liberation pushed them together as they laughed about their old lives. Sabrina was elated, but soon she began to feel faint. Finally, in front of the Apple store, she fell to the ground. Normally she would pop an oxy at lunch to take the edge off. It was 12:30 and her body was coming to the realization that the oxy would not come. She explained her situation to Iris who took her home and scolded her. \n\n     \"How could you play dress-up with me when you were in such pain!\" \n\n     \"I just wanted to be with you\" she mumbled, fading from consciousness.\n\x1d\xaaXi\n\n     Xi missed his 5:00 AM wake up call and slept in until 9:00 for the first time in decades. He missed his talk \"Achieving the People\'s Liberation through Technology and Automation\" with Ma. He expected WeChat would be buzzing with some kind of new meme to quash, maybe a sleepy Winnie the Pooh. But there was nothing. Not even some clever circumvention. Ma had probably delivered a beautiful, rousing speech that had made the hive forget about him entirely. How come nobody ever gave that weird-headed weasel a cartoon character? Nobody even made fun of him. Not even when he put out that embarrassingly crass action film. And that line at the end, \"We must enforce the law in a civilized manner!\" Such a transparent affront. Xi seethed, recalling every time Ma had upstaged him. He took a long sip of tea and a deep breath, and called him.\n\x1d\xaaTonita\n\n     Tonita had moved to Irvine to work for the Irvine Company five years ago when her job as a campsite supervisor couldn\u2019t cover the expenses of her father\'s lung cancer treatment. Starting off as a lowly administrative assistant, she ruthlessly climbed the corporate ladder. She did more and more favors for her boss, taking on his responsibilities, just to be helpful, until she casually let something slip to her boss\u2019s supervisor at the holiday party. She had his position in the new year.\n \n     With the raise, she was able to pay for her father\'s treatment, but he did not make it through the winter. A few weeks before the surgery, as he was taking his midday nap, his condition suddenly deteriorated and he was dead within a few hours. Tonita had not seen him since she left Santa Fe. She remembered getting the call as she was taking her lunch break in the corporate gardens of Irvine Company\'s office park, under the mild, inoffensive sun. She beat herself up: if only she had buckled down sooner, maybe her father could have gotten his treatment in time. Instead, she had temporarily hidden from the truth, distracting herself with the beauty of nature and the friendly smiles of campers. Her father\'s death had been reality\'s non-negotiable return. Money is life. \n \n     Tonita devoted herself to accumulating life in the form of money. She was a predator. She climbed and clawed her way to the top in a kill-or-be-killed world. She had ambitions: soon she would be a millionaire, next she would own her own hospital, and maybe someday even an island. Just like Donald Bren himself. She would break through everything that stood in her way, every single glass ceiling destroyed.\n \n     A violet sliver of dawn peeked behind the trees as Tonita arrived at Big Tesuque campground, but the stars were still cleanly visible through the crisp morning air. Tonita got out of her car and lay in the dew soaked grass, receiving the specks of light as they rushed in from far-away worlds. Of all the grandiose dreams that had once filled her head, returning to Big Tesuque was the only one that still meant anything. For the first time in years, she untensed herself. Tears welled up in her eyes.\n\x1d\xaaEmmanuel\n\n     Emmanuel woke up on the floor with a spinning hangover. Shards of fine porcelain and glass covered the room, and the centerpiece chandelier sat on the table like a dead, beached, jellyfish. He hobbled into the palace kitchen and grabbed a carton of orange juice, straining to stand up over the throbs of his champagne induced headache. Where the fuck was everyone? He tried to think back to what had happened the night before. The lobster had never arrived. Instead, he had shared glass after glass of champagne with Bernard and Vincent. The two had gotten into a dick measuring contest over who was the most cultured, quoting Proust, Moliere, Pascal. \n\n     \"The Louis Vuitton Foundation for Creation is the pinnacle of french culture.\"\n \n     \"Your pathetic museum is a tangled, bulbous embarrassment, I modernized Africa!\"\n\n     They were so transparent. \"You two dipshits get it in your head to buy Hachette and all of a sudden you give a fuck about the human condition? Gimme a fuckin break! No disrespect, the museum was a nice tax dodge, and I like human rights violations as much as any other red-blooded man, but jesus fuckin\u2019 christ shut the fuck up!\" \n\n     Vincent emptied his glass onto Emmanuel. \"I fuckin\u2019 own you and your entire career!\" \n\n     As the headache subsided Emmanuel noticed a sharp pain in his left eye.\n\x1d\xaaIris\n\n     The next day about a third of people went back to work, a third moved on to other pursuits, and another third returned to their place of employment to undo what had once been their duty. Iris went to the doctor to get advice about taking care of Sabrina and to have her still aching arms looked at. \n \n     The news was positive. Sabrina had a difficult journey ahead of her, she would go through intense pain paired with a mild fever, vomiting and diarrhea, but would survive so long as she remained hydrated and fed. Iris breathed a sigh of relief. Even though they had just met yesterday, Sabrina had truly seen her. Moreover, she had seen her not just for who she was, but for who she wanted to be.\n \n     As for her arms, the diagnosis was light nerve damage from poor ergonomic conditions and repetitive movement: a condition solvable by discontinuing the activity. Iris thought back to her cramped, light gray and beige cubicle, how nearing national holidays she would go into a quiet jittery caffeine frenzy under the needle-hum fluorescent lights, late into the night. Cup after cup of cold black coffee as she went through the thousands of suspicious, but ultimately benign emails that accumulated on her work computer. It was a distant but painful memory. Never again, she vowed.\n\x1d\xaaTonita\n\n     Tonita spent the morning warming her body on her favorite rock. She watched the New Mexico whiptails as they licked the air for flies and alternated between sun and shade. Twenty years ago she had sat on the same rock with her father. He had told her that animals were perfect beings, always acting honestly and sincerely, with the entirety of their spirit. They seemed so happy as they darted around, even the one that had lost her tail. Feeling recharged, Tonita headed into town to get food.\n \n     There were no more cashiers at the grocery stores, but crowds still formed around the front as it was a good place to find people to have dinner with. A bright flash of green hair stood out in the mass of people. Tonita made eye contact with the nervous looking goth girl and confidently approached. \n\n     \u201CHi, what kind of food do you like?\u201D\n\n     \u201CUm, I don\u2019t know, everything I guess.\u201D \n\n     Iris went on to explain that she had never cooked a real meal but wanted to impress the new friend she had made the day before. Iris\u2019 shy but warm personality attracted Tonita. She offered to make them blue corn chile rellenos, her favorite childhood meal.\n\n     When Iris and Tonita arrived at Iris\u2019s home, Sabrina was at the peak of her withdrawal. Iris sat in the dark room with her and held her hand while Tonita began preparing the beans and the salsa. Tonita had never taken the time to cook a nice meal in Irvine. She was excited to taste chile rellenos, fried the way her father used to make them, with fresh chiles, and to share the meal with her new friends.\n \n     About an hour later, Sabrina and Iris appeared and helped put the finishing touches on the feast. Sabrina had regained her color and had a lively bounce to her as she set the table. The women sat down and ate. They celebrated their successes, which a few days ago had seemed impossible. They were on the same wavelength as they opened up to each other about their anxious anticipation for the next chapter in their lives. Sabrina and Iris could taste the love in Tonita\'s cooking, and it filled them with warmth. The women looked brightly to the future, wondering what it might hold.\n\x1d\xaaElon\n\n     Claire had not come home from the studio the night before, which was normal for her when she was \"flowing\" on a new project. But she hadn\u2019t Signal\u2019d him. Nor had she posted to her Insta. Elon checked the value of a Tesla share. A clean fibonacci retracement between two doji. Time for some meme magic, he thought. Following his shitpost, the share price went up ten percent for five minutes, then went back down just as fast. The post got a lot of likes and retweets but the comments weren\'t very creative. Most seemed to have been posted by bots. A boring day on the internet. Time to blaze a dank morning fatty.\n\x1d\xaaJoseph\n\n     Joseph no longer paid attention to MSNBC, which went on with its reheated stories and automatically generated stock quotes. At least the market was doing alright. He thought back to what his mentor Barack had told him: \"Being president is all about being an escape valve for people\'s frustrations so that the market can do its thing.. well, that and making the surveillance and remote warfare boys feel like good guys.\" Had he become so obsessed with the first half of his job that he forgot the second? He clutched the biscuit and eyed the football, but wondered if it would even work if he were to use it. And if it did work, how would he know? He felt alone. \n \n     His sense of reality momentarily faltered, and he fantasized that that darned dookieposter Q had been right all along: half of the people he knew were satanic pedophiles, the other half god fearing freedom fighters; and he was just an old man caught up in the middle of all of it. If that was the case, then at any moment he could expect Donald J. Trump to swoop in draped in an American flag like a true savior of the nation. He dismissed the idea. \n\x1d\xaaDonald\n\n     Donald was bored. A lot of his \"friends\" wouldn\'t be seen with him or even visit him anymore. Cowards! His favorite escort service let his call go to voicemail five times in a row. Embarrassing! His lawyers ignored him. You\'re fired! Mike had hit him up a few days ago, but at that point he might as well do his lines alone. That guy was a weird, angry man. He turned on OAN and set up a Diet Coke and powdered coke to calm his nerves, lining up the powder on a copy of his presidential portrait in an ornate gold leaf frame. Just as he was nasally vacuuming the last bits of dust from his smiling face he felt a tingling in his left arm, followed by a tightness in his chest. He died.\n\x1d\xaaXi\n\n     It turned out that Ma had also missed the talk when his driver failed to pick him up. The broadcast had simply shown the empty chairs for two hours. The worst part was that nobody seemed to care. All people seemed to talk about was how many eggs to bring home, if they were out of laundry detergent or toothpaste, and when they would get to the museum. If it was a workaround, it must be something brilliant. Never had those idealistic activists come up with a trick and had it adopted so widely and so rapidly. And it must be convenient too, if people weren\'t even gossiping about celebrities in the open. No one in the Ministry for Information Industry would pick up or respond to calls. Were they in on it? They were probably scrambling. This couldn\'t be some people\'s uprising, it had to be America.. or maybe Russia?\n\x1d\xaaThe Women\n\n     The next morning, Sabrina looked at her phone for the first time since she had met Iris and Tonita, and saw a text from her friend. The museum had become a center to process the massive influx of new information that had come with the \"big realization.\" The women decided to check it out.\n \n     The activity inside of the museum spilled out of the building. As they entered, the women wrote their names on pieces of paper for a lottery that was about to take place. The museum was packed with filing cabinets and stacks of harddrives that people rummaged through as if they were trinkets at a yard sale. The liberated information contained centuries of inconvenient secrets, billions of hours of careful thought, and trillions of dollars of expensive experimentation, now free for the benefit of all. \n \n     Progress was slow. These were, after all, laypeople wading into complicated scientific jargon and legalese. But the work was done carefully, helped along by academics and researchers. People were surprised to learn that there had been no secret alien contact, and that the Illuminati had never been all that powerful. They debunked some conspiracies, verified others, and uncovered some beyond the theorizing capabilities of the most imaginative quacks. It all seemed irrelevant now. \n\n     Iris heard her name over the loudspeaker: lottery ticket had been drawn. She was offered the position of coordinating the museum\'s activity with the other museum communities that had sprung up worldwide. She walked up nervously to the center of the room where the mic was set up for her to introduce herself. She hadn\'t spoken to a crowd larger than four people since college.\n\x1d\xaaJefferey\n\n     Jefferey had begged his crew to continue the mission, offering to double, triple, even quadruple their salaries, but they just looked at him with pity. Eventually the submarine surfaced in Palm Bay, and let him off. The crew said something about going back for some kind of environmental cleanup mission. They did not care that they could be tracked, and that they would, at best, spend years in prison for hijacking his submarine. \"International waters can be a very scary place\" Jefferey had insinuated to no avail.\n \n     Jefferey boiled with hot rage. His entire empire of convenience was meaningless if he couldn\'t go on his multi-million dollar exploratory excursions. His vision blurred as the relentless Palm Bay sun beat through his baseball cap, sweat dripping off his nose and chin. A faded turquoise Aerostar pulled up driven by a crusty, overweight man. \"Howdy Jeff! I\'m here to take you home.\" Jefferey would not have gotten into this disgusting, leathered man\'s disgusting, unleathered car except for the fact that he was beginning to feel dizzy. He sat down wordlessly. The radio blasted. \"Looord I was boooorn a ramblin maahaaan...\" The man greeted Jeffrey with a big smile that revealed his missing front tooth \"Howdy there! I\'m Big Tater Travis, thats my name!\" Jefferey sat silently. <i>What does this man want? Any moment now, my team will have received the distress call and tracked my implant.. Certainly faster than this yokel can roast me over a campfire.<\/i> \"We got a long road ahead, so gimme a holler if you wanna pull off to make some water.\" The smells of mesquite and mildew mixed in the conditioned air. \n\x1d\xaaMark\n\n     Mark had not seen Priscilla for a few days. It was not unusual for her to stay at the neighboring houses since he owned those as well. She said she needed time to meditate. He had pretended not to notice the beat-up red Corolla that was often parked nearby on those meditation days. One day he had watched the large muscular man that could barely fit into his car exit and embrace her. He snapped pictures of them laughing, kissing, making love. He was not angry. He was too familiar with human weakness to be disappointed in anything anyone could do. But the information was valuable. At this point, even Priscilla knew that he knew, and their marriage had fallen into a steady, comfortable rhythm. But this evening was different. All four of his surrounding buffer houses had lights on. He felt as if the lights were looking at him. He called first for his security, then the police, but no one answered. He felt simultaneously alone and watched. Finally, his phone rang. It was that asshole Elon.\n\x1d\xaaXi\n\n     After a call with Russia, Xi was relieved to learn that they were not behind what had occured, but this only made whatever force had taken out all of their subordinates more menacing. The defection seemed to be coordinated and far reaching. The American press also seemed to have gone dark. Were they also victims? Or were they silently waiting to strike? Xi brought up some video feeds. There was no rioting, and traffic was running more smoothly than usual, but as he clicked through the channels he was unable to find a single policeman. The algorithms did not detect anger or discontentment on the passing faces. Xi thought back to his time in Liangjiahe. How many times there had he brushed with starvation or death? How many times had he been given the label of counterrevolutionary? He decided to leave Zhonghanhai. Whatever was going on out there, he would meet it head on.\n\x1d\xaaEmmanuel\n\n     The previous day, after his headache had quieted down, Emmanuel had gone through his entire rolodex trying to reach his advisors and aides, but no one answered. Had everyone dropped him? He panicked. The fact that the news made no mention of him hinted at the size of the story they likely had on him. He had gone through every department, every mayor, every representative, every connection. Not even a secretary. He had tried again this morning to no avail. He had been icing his black eye, but the pain had increased and he could no longer see through it. His mind raced as he imagined what had gotten out that would make everyone ostracize him. The dining hall remained in shambles as the servants were also gone. He despaired, and with no one else to turn to, called his mother. \n\n     \"Hello, son.\" He burst out crying, the salty tears stinging his left eye, he was unable to utter a word.\n \n     \"How about you come by for dinner.\"\n\x1d\xaaThe Women\n\n     There were more people at the museum the next day as essential tasks were quickly being automated. Progress processing the information sped up when Iris, with the help of people in Utah, repurposed the Pinwale collection and retrieval system, making the servers accessible worldwide. Sorting through the scientific data was similar to sorting through the private emails of people of interest. The raw data was analyzed and reanalyzed by the state of the art computer intelligence systems that drew up tiers of importance, categories, and relational graphs, coordinating the many hands that combed over the freed exabytes.\n \n     While rapid advances were being made in all fields, special attention was paid to understanding the mind. The shift in perception that had occurred had revealed a gaping perceptual blind spot, while simultaneously showcasing the mind as a source of liberation. Many wondered what else they were missing, what else they might unlock.\n \n     It turned out that nearly every major power had designed some sort of mind reading device, and that a more elite subset had also developed mind control devices. Each represented the apex of the power\u2019s respective institutions of surveillance and coercion, but there was no evidence of them ever being used. This didn\'t seem to result from any moral hesitation tied to the technology. Instead, there had simply been no need. Careful application of economic policy, media, police, pharmaceuticals, imprisonment, physical and psychological torture had been sufficient in maintaining the collective illusion, and the mind control machines had remained in their secret vaults untouched.\n \n     Each of these devices was unique since they had been developed in secret from the others. Each reflected a different approach to handling the human experience. With surprising speed, people combined these devices, creating a new, more powerful machine. This was not a machine to control the mind or see its contents. It was a machine for self exploration; a way to navigate the secret channels of the psyche. They called it the cognitive mirror.\n\x1d\xaaMark\n\n     Mark heard the screeching of tires in the distance and braced himself. Moments later, Elon was at his gate in his deep crimson Model S. He stumbled out drunkenly, bottle of whisky in hand.\n\n     \"The Zuck-Maaaan!!!\" \n\n     Mark inhaled slowly and deeply, \"Hey how bout you serve me some of your signature wild boar, the stores all gave up on meat or some shit..\"  \n\n     Mark led Elon to his barbecuing backyard. \n\n     \"You been out there bro? It\'s fuckin wild, lawless, someone hacked all the supercharger stations to give out free power! And nobody would even listen to me about it, I mean come on, I\'m Elon Fucking Musk!\"\n\n     Mark presided over the Big Green Egg with a watchful eye. \"I have applied the Sweet Baby Ray\'s, but the meat fibers have not yet been properly tenderized.\" \n\n     Elon swigged his whisky. \"Listen, I know my history, and things like this, well, they don\'t end well for people like us.\" \n\n     Mark uncapped the Big Green Egg, the smoky Sweet Baby Ray\'s scented steam escaping in a billowing cloud. \n\"This is optimal, the heat and acidity have broken down the collagen between the meat-fibers. Now what remains is to let the meat rest\" Mark picked up the ribs with a set of meat tongs and brushed on a final layer of Sweet Baby Ray\'s. \n\n     \"I hear there\'s an island for our kind, where we might be safe?\"\n\n     As Mark eyed the resting meat, he thought back to the boar it had once belonged to. He had stealthily hunted it, silently tracking it until he knew its habits, and then when it, she, went off alone, he finished her with an arrow to the head. A flash of life flickered in his eyes. \"Let\'s take a road trip to Washington.\" His eyes went cold again. \"I\'m driving.\" \n\n     The Technoking of Tesla lowered his sunglasses, making eye contact with Mark. \"No, I\'m flying.\"\n\x1d\xaaXi\n\n     Xi left the palace and walked to Tiananmen Square where some people sat outside. There were still no guards, and a group had set up a ladder and was beginning to uninstall the surveillance cameras. He approached.\n \n     \"Hello comrades.\" \n\n     \"Hey\"\n\n     These people had to know who he was, how could they be so unfazed and address him like that? \n\n     \"What are you doing?\" he asked. \n\n     \"These are useless, but we can salvage the optical systems and some of the chips.\"\n\n      The calm rationality completely broke from any of the dissident profiles he had studied. \"What do you mean useless? These help keep everyone safe\" \n\n     They laughed, \"But we are already safe.\" \n \n     Xi continued to walk around the square, seeing the genuine smiles of people going about their days, and the way they disregarded him as if he was just another person. He walked around town and saw the cashierless stores and empty offices. He entered one of the museums and listened in to the lively discussions that were taking place. He had an idea.\n \n     He set up a PA system at the square\'s north gate and began his historical address. \"The last few days represent major progress in the people\'s struggle for liberation.\" Passers-by stopped and looked for a moment before continuing on. \"We come ever closer to realizing Mao\'s great vision, but there are those who stand in our way, who seek to sabotage us..\" No one cared. \"We will not succeed in bringing forth the new era until we have purged this cancer from within our ranks!\" He waited a moment to see if any reaction would come, then gave up, returning to his palace dejected.\n\x1d\xaaEmmanuel\n\n     Emmanuel snuck out of the Elysee in the non-presidential Crossback. He made his way to his mothers place in the countryside under a dizzying cloud of emotions. He felt a burning shame, as if every passerby on the street was staring into the blackness of his soul, even though there was no way they could see through his tinted windows. He felt freedom: relief at the idea that soon he might, for the first time in years, no longer be the most hated man in France; that he might get to be just be a regular person having dinner with his mother. He felt a hysterical confusion, as if the world was telling a joke and he was the punchline. He was a one eyed, distracted driver, one that had relied on a chauffeur for the last five years. He drove directly into a sign at a roundabout.\n \n     A paramedic arrived at the crash and helped him out of the car. He was not badly injured, just shaken up. He was taken to the Vaugirard Hospital, and when he asked the paramedic why he was not being taken to the military hospital, she simply replied that this one was closer. She was either an imbecile or was pretending not to recognize him. The other hospital staff seemed to be in on the conspiracy as well since they made him wait about fifteen minutes to see a doctor. Perhaps it was for the best that he maintained a low profile. When the doctor arrived he was immediately concerned with Emmanuel\u2019s eye, which the doctor said was infected. The doctor took a sample. Emmanuel\u2019s mother arrived, visibly worried. \n\n     \"My child! Are you ok?\" \n\n     \"I\'ve lost everything, I don\'t even have the influence to get out of a public hospital and my subordinates won\'t even talk to me!\" \n\n     She caressed his head, \"Oh mon petit. The world is not the same but you\'ll be fine.\"\n \n     The doctor returned with a grim look on his face. \"I\'m afraid we will have to amputate your eye.\" The gears in Emmanuel\'s head began to turn. The way people were treating him, this new attitude everyone had, it was simply the age old hatred of authority bubbling to the surface. The mob had finally taken control and now it would take its revenge, exacting literal \u201Ceye for an eye\u201D morality. And it would not stop there. A surge of adrenaline overtook him. He ran out of the hospital, commandeered the first vehicle he saw, and rushed back to the palace, this time managing only a few dents and scratches on the car. He barricaded himself in the Elysee, and with nowhere else to turn, dialed the White House.\n\x1d\xaaJeffrey\n\n     The rescue party had never arrived. Instead, once he reached the freeway, Big Tater Travis rolled down the windows and began to sing along with the radio. Jefferey endured this for hours. There were no commercials. Then, as the sun began to fade, Travis pulled off the road and set up a small tent while Jeffrey watched. Once the tent was set up, Big Tater Travis went to the back of his van where he grabbed a big bag of firewood and a smaller bag of russet potatoes. \n\n     \"I tell you son, you have not lived until you have tasted my signature spuds!\"\n\n     This man might be eccentric, but he was no killer. Jefferey thought about how great of a story this would make at Davos, over champagne and deconstructed poulet Ni\u00E7oise bites. \n\n     Big Tater Travis set up the fire and carefully placed two large foil covered potatoes near the embers. \"When I lost the warehouse job, used to be taters all I could afford, but these days I cook em up so lip smackin good I won\'t eat nothin else no way no how.\" \n\n     Jefferey decided to speak. \"Thank you for picking me up and for taking me all this way. I promise you will be rewarded handsomely\" \n\n     Big Tater Travis laughed heartily \"Your money\'s no good cowboy\". He picked up his guitar and began to strum aimlessly.\n \n     About an hour later, Big Tater Travis retrieved the potatoes, which he split open and seasoned with some green onions, pepper, and a pinch of salt. Jefferey, who was no stranger to culinary delicacies, was floored by how fluffy yet filling the potatoes were. And while the seasonings were sparse, they complemented the natural earthy flavor of the russets perfectly. \n\n     \"Workin the warehouse, you see, that was all about stayin quick, but cookin a good tater, well for that you gotta take it slow.\" He laughed. \"You know they used to call me Big Toter Travis on account of how often I got them \'Time Off Task\' write ups... that and I didn\'t cook no taters back then neither.\" \n\n     This man was a real character, with genuine charm. \"What do you say I hire you as my personal chef, 7k a month.\" \n\n     Big Tater Travis just laughed his hearty, jovial laugh.\n\x1d\xaaThe Women\n\n     Users of the cognitive mirror not only developed a better understanding of themselves, but were oftentimes also able to unlock latent skills: new languages, athletic abilities, musical talents. People got on waiting lists to try the device, while others waited cautiously on the sidelines. Iris, Sabrina, and Tonita had signed up at the same time, and so they used the device together. They were nervous, feeling both fear of the new technology and anxiety over what they might see in themselves. The device seemed to be no more than a pair of sunglasses with the reflective coating on the wrong side, showing the women nothing but their own eyes. The women held each other\'s hands and waited as the devices began to operate. \n \n     Slowly, almost imperceptibly, the reflection of their eyes opened up into a dizzying infinite regress. They perceived themselves perceiving themselves, piling layer upon layer to their awareness until they became innumerable. Then, a detachment. They watched the entire process from a seemingly outside perspective, their sunglass eyes perceiving recursively to an external version of them. However, the moment they adjusted to this view they perceived themselves perceiving it, starting off another cascade. As the layers built up, there were sometimes bumps or wrinkles, points where the perception wasn\'t quite right. These disappeared the moment they revealed themselves. The layers kept going, until just when it was clear that they would go on forever. Then they stopped.\n \n     When the women removed the sunglasses, they found that they could hear each other in their minds. After confirming that their telepathic abilities were not imaginary, they began to develop them further, increasing their range and transmission capacity. They unlocked the ability to reach others and hear their surface level thoughts. After a few more hours spent mastering the ability, they were able to project it to others around the world, creating a global network of directly linked minds.\n \n     It was then that people discovered that some were not receptive to the recently discovered telepathy. Fran\u00E7oise, Emmanuel\'s mother, could not reach him, despite how worried she was, and Big Tater Travis had to talk out loud to Jefferey, who still thought he could spend his fortune. After a world-wide roll call, a pattern emerged. It seemed that those who had been in control, and who, as a result, had not experienced the collective illusion as an oppressive force, had not been freed from it. \n \n     These people had not been part of the human community that had formed in the recent days, and their minds were unprepared for the telepathic abilities that had revealed themselves. They were cut off and afraid. To some of them, the changes around them were a mental disease from which only they had been spared, while to others, this was the revolution they had always feared, and that they knew they deserved. When they were approached by people offering to let them use the cognitive mirror, they ran off, frightened, or worse, attacked with sometimes deadly force. It was decided to leave these people alone, but to treat them with friendship and respect in any interactions.\n\x1d\xaaElon and Mark\n\n     Elon\'s Gulfstream G550 landed in the Rose Garden. It had been a relatively smooth ride thanks to Elon\'s proprietary automatic pilot feature. Elon and Mark searched through the deserted White House and eventually found Joseph in the bunker. They asked him about the island, and at first, Joseph claimed that it did not exist, but after Elon explained that his jet was likely the only way to get there, he acquiesced. He pulled off his suit jacket and removed a piece of fabric that had been sewn into the collar. The GPS coordinates to Diaemus Island. \"But we\'re making a stop in France first\"\n\x1d\xaaDiaemus Island\n\n     When their drivers did not arrive to pick them up at the palace, Vincent and Bernard went on alert. These were men they had vetted thoroughly, men whose psychological profiles precluded this sort of behavior. They walked down to Fouquet\'s to find it deserted but undamaged. The doors were unlocked, but the fine tableware sat undisturbed. Across the street, the flagship Louis Vuitton boutique was similarly deserted but unpilfered, and Bernard could not reach any of his subordinates at LVMH to get an explanation for the store closure. \n \n     Vincent and Bernard had history dealing with people and their various attempts at emancipation, and this did not correspond to any of the usual behavior patterns. Whatever was happening, they decided it would be best if it went on while they were far away, at Diaemus Island. The island, which had been created long ago by a group of more established elites to host secret parties, also served as a survival bunker designed for disasters ranging from nuclear armageddon to global revolution. Bernard and Vincent reached the island by superyacht and found it to be empty, as it often was during the summer season. \n \n     As members of the Diaemus Society, they had the access codes to everything on the island: fallout shelters, food reserves, water purification and sanitation systems, and perimeter surveillance and defense. They immediately changed the codes to secure full control for themselves. The last person who had done this, Michael Rockefeller, had been tortured until he revealed the new codes and then left to slowly bleed to death over the grates of the island\'s main altar. This time however, access would be too important to risk killing the sole code-holders over.\n \n     As other elites began to arrive, a hierarchy formed. Vincent and Bernard were the supreme leaders. Directly below them fell the leaders of nuclear powers, followed by the jet and yacht owners, and finally, the less fortunate elites, who had owned jets and yachts of their own, but could not pilot them. They were forced to leave them moored in their home countries when they hitched rides with their peers to reach the island.\n \n     Emmanuel, who had arrived in Elon\'s G550 along with Mark and Joseph, had his eye looked at by Thomas Frist Jr.,the for-profit healthcare pioneer and physician who, of the various men on the island (excluding the difficult Bashar Al Assad), came the closest to being an ophthalmologist. At this point, the infection had spread to his other eye, and both eyes would need to be enucleated to protect his brain. Vincent and Bernard, who perceived Emmanuel to be a threat, were relieved.\n\x1d\xaaThe Ascended People\n\n     The telepathic network accelerated. People became telekinetic, and after honing their abilities, could manipulate matter at a subatomic level using only their minds. They created beautiful, intricate structures, but often dematerialized them shortly after. \n \n     People gained the ability to leave their bodies at will, explored the depths of the ocean, and began to reach for the vastness of space. They enjoyed intermingling their projections as doing so created a form of intimacy that flesh did not permit. Many ceased to maintain their physical forms, choosing to exist purely as energy beings. They began to form something larger, a vast agglomeration of souls that people dropped in and out of at will, a community of humans intimate enough to resemble a single god-like organism.\n \n     Using their absolute powers of perception, they investigated the mystery of the \"big realization\" and found that it had simply been a coincidence, that each person had shifted their perception independently, and that they just happened to have done so at the same time as everyone else. This was incredibly unlikely, statistically impossible even under the most generous assumptions, but it was the only explanation. It was as if the cosmos had contrived the situation just to prove a point. While they had hoped for a more satisfying answer, they were grateful to be so lucky.\n\x1d\xaaDiaemus Island\n\n     The vast caverns of the island\'s underground bunker contained enough food to sustain its inhabitants for about two thousand years, assuming reasonable population growth. Despite this, it was decided that the inhabitants would begin farming immediately. Bernard delivered an eloquent speech about self-sufficiency and future generations, but the crowd, who had once been behind the podium themselves, saw through it. They knew that the changes would happen regardless, that the fancy words and subsequent vote of the bomb-holders was simply a fig leaf to cover the truth: it would be necessary to keep those at the bottom busy to maintain the hierarchy.\n \n     Life on Diaemus Island came to resemble pre-realization society, though women and practical skills were more scarce. Vincent and Bernard were securely in power, while the bomb-holders outmaneuvered each other to represent more boat and plane owners, making alliances and plotting betrayals. The owners, in turn, fought each other to get a bigger share of the farming class and their protection tax. The farming class toiled in the fields and occasionally shanked each other with sharpened tin cans over owner rivalries. \n \n     When Bernard died, there was a day of mourning. Dr. Frist declared the cause of death to be a heart attack, caused by Bernard \"overworking himself in service of the island.\" The celebration was glorious and everyone was given full rations. Only the dumbest of the farming class dared say anything about the poisoning.\n \n     A violent rage festered beneath the desperate squalor of the farming class. These had once been political powerhouses, titans of industry, pillars of influence. They had taught themselves that they were better than others, smarter, harder working, more inspired. Finding themselves at the bottom of the hierarchy was a denial of their identity. Emmanuel, blind and with no allies left, became the outlet for their anger. A guard was dispatched to protect him, which made him even more despised. In reality, the guard\'s job was not to keep him safe, but simply to keep him alive so that he could continue absorbing the frustrations of the little people.\n\x1d\xaaBig Tater Travis\n\n     While Big Tater Travis could materialize already cooked and seasoned potatoes from thin air, he took pleasure in the old methods, growing the russets, green onions, and peppercorns in the dirt; in sync with the rhythm of nature. He enjoyed building a fire with his hands, and sitting by it while he watched his potatoes cook under the night sky. He had left his body once, and it was lovely, like dreams he had had of flying. He just loved cooking his potatoes more.\n \n     People showed him the amazing worlds that existed in the hidden corners of the universe and all the different ways things could be, and he showed them how happy you could be with fire, potatoes, green onions, and salt. They all knew that he would be the last to leave. He had worked so hard to make a body he could feel at home in, and to feel at home in the body he had made. Now, he was an expert: a true \"homme de terre.\"\n \n     One time, just to confirm what he already knew, he had materialized a potato identical to one he had just cooked, down to the spins. He had watched his mind as he tasted both. The irrational part of him that perceived a difference was central to who he was, and he accepted it fully.\n \n     Eventually though, his body grew tired and painful to live in. He could have easily fixed this with a few changes to his cells, but things would not have been the same. He would have become a spirit pretending to be human bodied, going through the motions, simply maintaining a facade. He buried his body in the garden with a final crop of potatoes and went to join the flurry of incorporeal consciousness.\n\x1d\xaaThe Ascended People\n\n     With Big Tater Travis\' ascension, the only corporeal humans left on earth were the unrealized on Diaemus Island. The ascended people wanted to free them from their individualist hierarchy, and show them how they could connect with each other, but this was not possible without negating core aspects of their being. It would amount to killing them and then refashioning individuals that only vaguely resembled them. \n \n     The community of humans felt the pull of the universe and left the planet that had given birth to them, but before they left, Fran\u00E7oise went down to visit Emmanuel and say farewell.\n\x1d\xaaEmmanuel\n\n     Emmanuel woke up from a dream about his mother with his eyesight restored. He considered that the visions he was having were an illusion, that he had cracked and gone insane, but he decided he would run with it. Maybe this reality would be kinder to him. He put on the blindfold which he had once used to spare others the sight of his sockets and found he could see through the fabric. He continued to receive his beatings, and over the next months became accustomed to the pain. Eventually he was no longer entertaining to strike, being just too pitiful and passive. He moved up, becoming a sort of jester for the bomb-holders and owners to humiliate. His former position was filled by a farmer who had pilfered an extra ration and needed to be made an example of.\n \n     The bomb-holders and owners enjoyed playing tricks on Emmanuel for their amusement. Their favorite was to put hot coals in his path to see if he would step on them. After enduring the brutality of the farming class, he was able to step on the coals without flinching, and no one ever suspected that he had regained his sight. He continued to pretend to be blind for a few years as he formulated a plan. He got closer to Vincent and memorized his passcode, which was entered freely in front of him. Soon, he thought, he would become the supreme leader, and everyone who had hurt or humiliated him would pay. He snuck off in the middle of the night to test the code on the now abandoned bomb-shelters, changing the access permissions. With all the pieces in place, he decided to wait until the new month, when the leaders would be distracted by their own fancy talking, to make his big move.\n \n     That weekend, however, as Jair performed his weekly kick to the crotch ritual which everyone so enjoyed, Emmanuel\'s blindfold fell off, exposing his eyes. After a dumbfounded moment of frozen confusion, the men erupted into a frenzy of fear and rage. Emmanuel easily outran the flabby, overindulged leaders and made it to the nearest jet, whose controls he had been studying. He skipped the pre-flight checks and immediately pushed the engine to full throttle, blasting off of the island like a bat out of hell.\n \n     He returned to France and found his nuclear briefcase exactly where he had left it. He did not want to kill the islanders as he knew they were likely all that was left of humanity, but he had no choice. If he didn\'t, then they would track him down and kill him out of the fear that he would do exactly what he was in the process of doing. He entered their coordinates, apologized to his mother, wherever she was, and deployed one of his nation\'s American bought Peacekeeper missiles.\n\x1d\xaaThe Ascended People\n\n     The flurry of ethereal humans liked to stay together, after all they enjoyed each other\'s company, but sometimes individuals would venture off on their own, either for exploration or simply to experience solitude. As they became more advanced, the incorporeal swarm spent most of their time in neutron stars. There, molecules existed, but at a subatomic scale as opposed to a chemical one. These subatomic molecules carried out reactions similar to those that create life, but they did so one million times faster. While the ascended people were no longer tied to a physical substrate, they found that they too picked up on this faster timescale. Because of this, it felt like millions of years had passed when they were finally called back to Earth.\n \n     They rushed back in time to see the Peacekeeper complete the last mile of its trajectory. They knew that this kind of end was unavoidable, but it still hurt to watch. The sick part of humanity that they had separated themselves from had finally succumbed to itself, and they mourned the loss. \n\x1d\xaaEmmanuel\n\n     While Emmanuel survived, he was fated to be the last corporeal person. He spent a few years searching the planet before returning to France. He had thought about creating a monument to humanity, but he was no artist, and the structures that already existed would outlast anything he was capable of. A layer of moss began to cover the streets, and a family of deer established itself in front of his window. The animals were not afraid, and as he grew old, Emmanuel would spend more and more time with them. The years of simple living and solitude had warmed his soul, and watching nature reclaim the streets made him feel hopeful. He knew in his heart that whatever was next would be better than what came before. He only wished he could stick around to see it... As he drew his last breath, he had a vision of his mother. He apologised to her for all that he had done. A bright light enveloped him as a soothing warmth cradled him.\n\x1d";
